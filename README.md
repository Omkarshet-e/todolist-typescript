# React TodoList App

React todolist is a minimalistic TodoList app crafted with **React** and **TypeScript**. With it, you can effortlessly add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The interface is intuitive, featuring local storage integration, persisting user todos even after refreshing the tab or closing and reopening the app, ensuring continuous access to user todos.
